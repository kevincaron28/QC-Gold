# Changelog

## Unreleased

**Discord bot**
- **17 commands instead of 34.** Related commands now sit under one parent: `/setup` (`start`, `config`, `testraid`, `selfroles`), `/character` (also `who`, `profession`, `attunement`, `wishlist`, `readiness`), `/raid wcl`, `/dungeon admin`, `/mod application`, `/import upload` and `/import apply`, and a new `/report` (`stats`, `inactive`, `guild`, `export`, `ping`). The old top-level names are gone; the guided setup is now `/setup start`. Nothing else changed: same options, same permissions, same results.
- **Legacy DKP is hidden.** It is gone from `/profile` and `/epgp dkp` is no longer offered; the stored data and the addon import are untouched.
- `/setup config channel` replaces the eleven separate `/config ...-channel` commands: pick which channel from a list, then the channel.

**In game**
- **The Ready page now runs by itself.** When anyone starts Blizzard's ready check, every Guilded in the group looks at itself and reports what it carries to the group (flask, food, augment and vantus rune, raid buffs, weapon enchant, durability), spread over a second or two. When the check ends, the leader or officer sees a summary of who has a problem in their chat window. Nothing to press. Guilded also reports again by itself when your flask or food changes, and when you join a group (never in combat, only when something changed).
- **One icon per check** on the Ready page: ready check answer, flask, food, weapon enchant, augment rune, vantus rune, raid buffs, durability and gear. A green tick is there, red is missing, grey is missing but not required, amber is running out, and a question mark means nobody could tell. Hover a row for the full reasons and where they came from. Class-coloured names, and a line for how the latest ready check went.
- **A hidden buff is never "missing".** Buffs are read by spell id and icon, so a French client works as well as an English one, and a player who is out of range, phased, offline or whose buffs the game hides shows a question mark (or comes from their own addon's report), not "no flask".
- **Running out** (flask, food or weapon enchant under 10 minutes), **raid buffs** (only the ones someone in the group can give), **weapon enchant, augment rune and vantus rune** (off by default) and **durability** are checked. Officers choose what counts with `/guilded ready require <flask|food|buffs|weapon|augment|vantus> on|off`, `/guilded ready expiry <minutes>`, `/guilded ready durability <percent>`, `/guilded ready report on|off` and `/guilded ready autopost on|off` (tell the group at the end of a ready check); `/guilded ready settings` shows them.
- Blizzard's own answers are shown too: who said ready, who said not ready (that makes them Not ready), and who never answered.
- Only the player themselves can report themselves, and only through raid or party chat.

- **Attunements track themselves.** Tell your addon once which quest (or reputation) an attunement needs: `/guilded attune track "Hyjal Summit" quest <id>` (or `rep <factionId> <standing>`). From then on it records the attunement by itself when you complete it and tells the guild; no more filling it in. Nothing is built in, because WoW Forever's raids (Barrow Deeps, Hyjal Summit, Onyxia's Lair) differ from the old ones. `/guilded attune tracked`, `untrack` and `auto` (look now) manage it. It only adds, never clears; `/guilded attune` by hand still works. Officers keep what each guildmate reports about themselves.
- **One player, one name.** "Ray" and "Ray pissjug" (name plus a realm written with a space) are now the same person in the group list and everywhere else.

**Credits:** spell ids and the approach follow Ready Check Consumables (MIT); see `docs/CREDITS.md`.

## 3.3.0

**In game**
- **Ready page** in the Guilded window (and `/guilded ready`): everyone in your raid or party, worst first, coloured Ready / Issues / Not ready / No data, with the reason (no flask, no food, missing enchants, empty gear slots, low durability, old data, offline, no addon). It combines what each player's addon shared with a live look at their buffs, and updates by itself while the page is open. It is **for officers and group leaders only** (guild officers, and the leader or an assistant of the current raid or party); other members do not see the page and `/guilded ready` tells them so.
- **Ready check:** "Ask everyone to check" (`/guilded ready ask`) makes every addon in the group look at itself again and answer within seconds; "Post to group chat" tells the group who needs attention. Addons answer a request only when it comes from an officer, the group leader or an assistant, through raid or party chat, never in combat, and at most every 20 seconds.

## 3.2.0

**In game**
- **Guilded chat tab** (optional): `/guilded chat tab` opens a chat tab named Guilded and sends the addon's own lines there (bid results, sync status, command answers), keeping raid chat readable. `/guilded chat off` goes back. Messages to the raid, party and whispers are not affected.
- Item tooltips speak French on a French client.

**Discord bot**

**Français / French**
- `/setup` now starts with a language choice (English / Français). In French the whole setup guide and its checklist are French, and it creates a French server: categories (Guilde, Raids, Donjons, Artisanat, Officiers), channels (`guilded-annonces`, `inscriptions-raid`, `cores-de-raid`, `rapports-raid`, `butin`, `inscriptions-donjon`, `classement-donjons`, `donjons-termines`, `tableau-artisanat`, `journal-officiers`, `preparation-raid`) with French topics, and French permission roles (Maître de guilde, Officier, Chef de raid, Officier DKP, Chef du butin, Chef de classe). Both spellings of a role or channel are recognized, so an existing English server keeps working and can be mixed.
- French for what members see in channels: the raid signup post, the core roster, the craft board (tags, posts, buttons, forms, direct messages), dungeon groups, polls and the Warcraft Logs card, plus the announcements and reminders that were already translated.
- Still English for now: officers' own screens and replies (core wizard and editor, EP proposals, readiness board, most command replies), and the slash command descriptions.

## 3.1.0

**In game**
- **Item tooltips:** an item wanted by someone on the guild's wishlists (or awarded before) shows who wants it, what it usually costs in GP and your own priority (PR and rank). It comes from the bot and is shared with the guild like the standings; turn it off with `/guilded modules off tooltip`.

**Discord bot**

- **Warcraft Logs, automatic:** `/config wcl-guild guild:<page link>` makes the bot find the guild's new public reports itself, post them in the raid logs channel and attach each to the raid it matches by time.
- **Officer check** (`/wcl check`, also sent to the officer log for every new report): players in the log but not credited or the reverse, characters not linked to a Discord member, EP not awarded yet, who came to boss pulls without a flask or food, and deaths. No damage or parse numbers.

## 3.0.2

**In game**
- The game is never reloaded on its own any more. Auto-reload is off for everyone (opt in with `/guilded sync auto on`); officers get a small banner with a Send to Discord button, and logging out also saves.
- `/guilded modules on <module>` now confirms.

**Discord bot**
- Raid signup posts list the players in every role with the count and FULL, mark core members (⭐) and the bench (🪑), and show which core members have not signed up yet.
- New `/core edit`: add or move players, change roles, use a bench of replacements, remove players and rename a core from one message. `/core add` has a `bench` option.
- Fixed the "invalid string length" error on step 3 of `/core setup`.
- Craft board: members can talk inside a request post and press its buttons but not start posts; officers fix an older board with `/craft permissions`.
- The addon-import notice goes to the private officer log.

## 3.0.1

Renamed to **Guilded** (`/guilded`, short `/gd`; the old `/qg` is gone, saved data from the old name is adopted once).

- Me page: the Attunements block no longer overlaps a long gear result; readiness shows as Ready / Partly ready / Not ready.
- Bidding: officers can try it alone inside a test raid (`/guilded sim start`, then `/guilded sim bids`); nothing is sent to chat.
- Bot: no crash when Discord drops a slow command, database keepalive, clearer message when a character is already linked.

## 3.0.0

A big release: everything below since 1.x, polished for the public.

**In game (addon)**
- A new tools window: a sidebar with grouped pages, a **Home** page (what is going
  on, your standing, your gear check, whether your data reached Discord) and
  tooltips. Officers get Raid, EPGP and Loot pages.
- **Send to Discord**: one button (or `/guilded sync`) saves your data; officers'
  addons also do it by themselves at safe moments (out of combat, outside instances).
- **Roll games** (high roll, deathroll, duel). No gold, no wagers, no debts.
- **Mass invite**: `/guilded invite raid` invites everyone signed up for the next raid on Discord;
  `/guilded invite missing` lists who is not in your group.
- **Gear and consumable checks**: missing enchants, flasks, food; a readiness line
  for the whole raid.
- **Backup and restore** of your saved data (`/guilded backup`, `/guilded restore`), separate
  saved data per WoW guild.
- **Auto-invite** by whisper, login digest, read-only API for other addons
  (`GuildedAPI`), `/guilded diag` with slow-handler timings.
- Clear reasons when standings are missing instead of a generic "not linked".

**Discord bot (optional)**
- `/setup` wizard that makes and organises every channel with the right permissions.
- Raid cores with signup priority, per-core point rules and pools, `/core setup`.
- Weekly repeating raids, dungeon groups with temporary voice channels, polls,
  loot council mode, bench credit, Warcraft Logs import.
- Craft board as a forum: one post per request with tags and buttons.
- Automatic character discovery and linking; `/character import` for anyone.
- Dropdowns and suggestions instead of typing.
- Companion desktop app with a tray icon, settings window and activity log.
- Deploy kit for a free Oracle Cloud server.

**Removed**: the casino games and the gold debt ledger; the recruitment posts.
