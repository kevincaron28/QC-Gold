# Guilded

Raid and guild management for **WoW Forever** guilds: an in-game addon, a Discord bot and a small
Windows companion app that connect the two. Free for noncommercial use ([license](LICENSE)).

| Part | What it does | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Addon** | Raids, attendance, EPGP, GP bidding, gear and consumable checks, roll games, a friendly window (gold coin on the minimap). Works alone, no Discord needed. | `addon/Guilded/` |
| **Discord bot** (optional, self-hosted, free) | Raid signups with roles and waitlist, raid cores with a bench, weekly raids, EPGP standings, loot log, dungeon challenge, craft board, readiness board, polls, Warcraft Logs, applications, moderation helpers. | `src/` |
| **Companion app** (optional) | Tray app that sends the addon's saved data to the bot after each `/reload` or logout and writes standings back into the game. | `companion-app/`, `companion/` |

Every in-game and Discord command, and who can run it, is in [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md).
What changed in each version: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

- **Just the addon:** unzip `Guilded-v<version>.zip` into `World of Warcraft\_forever_\Interface\AddOns\`
  (a folder named `Guilded`), restart the game, type `/guilded` or click the gold coin.
- **The whole system (bot, addon, companion):** follow [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Requirements (bot)

- Node.js 22+ and npm 10+
- PostgreSQL 16+ (a free [Neon](https://neon.tech) database works well)
- A Discord application with a bot token and the `applications.commands` scope
- **Server Members Intent** turned on for the bot (Developer Portal, Bot, Privileged Gateway Intents)
- The bot's own role must sit above your applicant and member roles, or role assignment silently fails

## Setup (development)

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local      # then fill in the values
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:update                      # applies the database migrations
npm run dev
```

`.env.local` needs `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, `DATABASE_URL` and a random
`COMPANION_UPLOAD_TOKEN`. `WCL_CLIENT_ID` and `WCL_CLIENT_SECRET` are optional (they turn on `/raid wcl`).
On Windows, `start-bot.bat` does the database update, starts the companion app and restarts the bot if it
crashes. Never commit `.env*` or `companion/companion.config.json` (both are already gitignored).

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Run the bot with tsx |
| `npm test` | Run the tests (bot and addon, 300+) |
| `npm run build` | Type-check |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run db:update` | Apply migrations and regenerate the Prisma client |
| `npm run addon:zip` | Build `dist/Guilded-v<version>.zip` for release |
| `npm run companion:app` | Start the companion tray app |

Addon check before a release: `node addon/Guilded/validate-addon.mjs`.

## How the parts fit

```text
WoW addon --(saved file on logout or /reload)--> companion --(HTTP, local)--> bot --> Discord + database
                                                    ^                          |
                                                    +---- standings file <-----+
```

- The game only writes the addon's data file on `/reload` or logout, so a reload (or logging out) is what
  sends new data. Nothing reloads the game on its own unless a player opts in with `/guilded sync auto on`.
- Uploads wait as a preview until an officer runs `/import apply`, unless `/setup config auto-import` is on.
- The bot's local API listens on `127.0.0.1` only and rejects every request without the upload token.
- Each WoW guild keeps its own saved data in the addon; a realm rename keeps the data.

## Project layout
