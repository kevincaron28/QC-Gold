# Quebec Gold Companion

**Easiest: the desktop app** (`companion-app/`): a window with status, settings
and an activity log, plus a tray icon (green = running, red = a problem, amber =
setup needed). Closing the window keeps it running in the tray; it can start
with Windows. Double-click `start-companion-app.bat` (first run installs it),
or run `npm run companion:app`. Settings are stored in the app's own folder; the
first run picks up an existing `companion.config.json`. To build a normal
Windows installer: `cd companion-app`, `npm install`, `npm run dist` (needs
about 1 GB free disk; the installer lands in `dist/companion/`).

The command-line watcher below does the same job without a window; both use
`companion/engine.mjs`.

This lightweight companion watches a normalized addon export file and sends new exports to the bot. It runs on the same Windows computer as WoW and the bot.

## One-time setup

1. Copy `companion.config.example.json` to `companion.config.json`.
2. Put the same `COMPANION_UPLOAD_TOKEN` in the bot `.env` and the companion config.
3. Start the bot.
4. Run `node companion/watcher.mjs`.

The watcher can read the addon's Lua SavedVariables directly. It also accepts
a normalized JSON export matching the bot import contract:

```json
{
  "source": "QuebecGold",
  "exportedAt": "2026-09-24T00:00:00.000Z",
  "transactions": [
    {
      "character": "Player",
      "realm": "Realm",
      "amount": 10,
      "type": "AWARD",
      "reason": "Raid attendance"
    }
  ]
}
```

For a Lua file, the watcher converts the addon's append-only DKP ledger into
normalized transactions. Set `realm` in the companion config because the WoW
SavedVariables file does not reliably contain a realm identifier.

## EPGP standings written into the addon

On start and every 15 minutes the watcher also asks the bot for EPGP
standings (`GET /api/v1/standings`, same token) and writes them to
`Interface\AddOns\QuebecGold\Standings.lua`. The path is worked out from
`watchFile` (the folder that contains `WTF`); if your install is laid out
differently, add `"standingsFile": "<full path to Standings.lua>"` to
`companion.config.json`. The game reads it on login or `/reload`, and the
officer's client then shares it with online guildmates.
